Recently, pollution has been a huge challenge for the world. It reduces the amount of fresh air in the environment and prevents people from gaining a truly healthy lifestyle and body. Pollution not only destroys peopleâ€™s health but also impacts the economy of the world. The costs of having severe air pollution are clear when countries and businesses are overwhelmed financially by buying filters, masks, and purifiers to help us breathe the air inside. We hope to spread awareness about air pollution and its effects on the environment and ourselves in order to drive people to become more environmentally conscious when making decisions that could negatively affect the planet we all live on. This app will not only allow people to discover first-hand the effects of increased air pollution, but also give resources in order to donate or help out communities in need across the world. We hope to inspire people to take initiative in their communities to plant more trees and promote organizations that help the environment as a whole. In the next 5 months, we hope to have contributed significantly to several organizations that promote the welfare of the environment and to have allowed people to consciously make better decisions related to the environment.

Firstly, the game in the app is a good representation of how removing a single tree affects our already unstable world economy. Removing a tree and creating a fossil fuel burning factory in the game decreases money by $50700 and increases pollution by 3.4%. The game introduces a beneficial experience so people can better understand how pollution affects the world around us. Secondly, on the info page, we highlight the fact that burning fossil fuels can increase the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 3.4% in a single year. Lastly, we challenge the increased pollution of today with a solution of our own. We offer a chance for people to donate or volunteer for organizations that help our environment by planting trees, which is something we hope to inspire people to do after playing our game and recognizing the effects pollution can have on our environment. In this way, we are all coming together to promote clean, pollution-free air.

<br />
  Facing pollution is not something we can do alone. Rather, we need to work together to make our world safe and healthy for all living things.
